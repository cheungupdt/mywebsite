# My Safety Journey: From Concept to Reality

Today I want to share a bit about my journey in robotics - how I got started, the challenges I've faced, and where I see the field heading.

## The Beginning

My safety in jornery began with a anamatronic breaking in mid operation: "Anyone get hurt?"

This question led me down a path of discovery, from basic mechanical systems to complex autonomous machines, how to revise the design to make it more safe.

## Key Learnings

### 1. No one get hurt!

One of the most important question is: "Will you let people get hurt?" Of course not! Regardless of the financial implecation. The idea that someone in my project got hurt is very daunting to hear. There is always a financial limitation to projects, once you take on the project, you will bear that burden on. What is necessary and sufficient is always important to guage. 

### 2. Common Buzz word: "Safety"

We don't just make everything have infinite safety factor. That is impossible, and impractical. Due to a badminton racquet broken from use, do we make it significantly more rigid, and make it infinitely thicker and use strongest metal? Of course not! It will be impractical for usage. What is safe enough tie heavily to usability, time and financial choices.

### 3. Human Interaction and standard

How to communicate to bring forth the requirement? What is the standard for alignment? this is the key question we align with everyone.

## Current Focus

Right now, I'm particularly excited about:
- Different design systems for precise motion
- How to make it work with the world
- How to justify it's safety
- Creating more robots to help our world move forwards

## Looking Forward

The future of safety is bring people together to a better place. We're in the journey to bring thee world to a better place.
