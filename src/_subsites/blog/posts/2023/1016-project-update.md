Robotics Arm Progress/assets/images/posts

Significant progress on the robotics arm control system today! After three weeks of development, I've successfully implemented the inverse kinematics algorithm that allows for precise positioning in 3D space.

The most challenging aspect was optimizing the calculation speed to ensure real-time responsiveness. Through careful code optimization and leveraging GPU acceleration, I've reduced the processing time from 120ms to just 15ms per position update.

This improvement opens up new possibilities for more complex tasks that require rapid adjustments based on sensor feedback. Next week, I'll be integrating the vision system to enable object recognition and tracking.
