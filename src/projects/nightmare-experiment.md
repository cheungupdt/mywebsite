## Overview

We were asked to build some animatronics into a room that triggered surprise moments for the guest. One of which is a Baby Face that is standing right next to the door entrance to scare the visitor that they have just walked underneath a giant spider Baby Face. Due to the thin plates and wide span of the toy, there has been a lot of challenges back then when i interact with the Building Department to convey structural safety to HKBD.
