# Project 1 - Data Analysis Platform

## Overview

For my Robot with vision project. As i know in the beginning my VPS couldn't handle the processing power. I thought of trying out the Google Cloud Platform and Oracle Cloud. As Google has a lot of tools for me to tryout, where as Oracle has a nice free tier capability. Boy I was wrong, i end up setting my server to handle this. This is a much better solution to my problem
