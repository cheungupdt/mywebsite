## Overview

Various constructions have their own safety issues. Even with many years of experience, there are always key strategies we employ to ensure project safety and project success. 

## Technical Details
- **Project Timeline**: Various Project Timelines

## Strategies - Local Standards
From years of various project, design structures are easy, optimizing them are not, but the key is standards. Me and my team always able to find rough weight, and rough structural design from just seeing the design intend hand sketches, with relatively high accuracy from experience. So after a quick estimate of weight and respective bearing load requirement. We will quickly shift to strategies with standards, getting bases quick. 

if design have special wind code to follow, we will follow the wind code. If the design may expose to earthquake, will find the related earthquake standard. If design has water, then we will find the related water standards, and if water hygiene standard needed, those standards will be employed and related chemical consideration will be done. We will always request samples to ensure we can appropriately comply with local standards.

## Strategies - Local SME
Regardless of how experience we are, my team always seek for local SME when possible. Quick consultation to ensure local compliances is key to ensure we have project success.


## Counter proposal in Written Documents
Where projects have various changes, we always ensure the projects have proper written documentation that served as counter proposal. Like Basis of Engineering, and Scope of Work, these are key document to help the company to ensure liability for the company is manageable. Of course making sure the client buy-off before key fabrication is key. Afterall, none of us would like the project to go wrong.
