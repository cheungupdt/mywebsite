# My First Blog Post

This is my first blog post written in **Markdown**! 

## Here's what I'm using:

- Eleventy for static site generation
- Markdown for content
- Netlify for deployment
- VSCode for editing

## Code Example

```javascript
// This is some JavaScript code
function greet(name) {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
