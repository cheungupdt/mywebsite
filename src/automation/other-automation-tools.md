# Automation Tools

## Overview

There are different Automation tools out there, some are of specific niche. For business use, I definitely recommand n8n after trying out tools like Zapier and Node Red

## Zapier

### 1. Still Complex
- Things input are not much simpler than n8n, as a matter of fact, some of them are more complex in my opinion.

### 2. Costly
- The cost really piles up with Zapier, i did a few simple email automation and it fills up the task easily. 

### 3. Controls
- N8N has a lot more controls on the nodes, you can easily setup memory, various logics, retries, it is just more convienent once you get use to it. 

##
## Node Red

### 1. More Complex
- A lot more coding to be done before it can do specific action (unless the action is just on/off of a particular device)

### 2. Not built for business
- The setup overall are complete towards homelab user and programmer, maybe it can be implemented for some specific project, but definitely not for business.

### 3. Controls
- Node Red has a lot of nodes, but still n8n is much simplier to add memory and integrates to other business appliation.
