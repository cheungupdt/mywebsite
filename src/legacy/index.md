# Company Asset Establishment & Public Engagements

The true measure of leadership isn't just in projects delivered, but in systems created that endure beyond individual involvement. My legacy encompasses comprehensive knowledge management frameworks, company standards, and training systems that continue to empower teams years after implementation. At Artech Design and Production, I developed the company standard documentation that transformed onboarding efficiency and created alignment across design, fabrication, and quality control processes.

From welding and inspection procedures that became the gold standard for client confidence, to engineering calculation tools that accelerated workflow 3x-5x, I've focused on creating assets that multiply team effectiveness. The A3 welding procedure package—with its 35 detailed steps from fabrication drawings to final inspection—became so sought-after that clients requested copies for their own reference, though we wisely retained this competitive advantage.
