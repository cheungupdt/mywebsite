# Welding Procedure and Welding Inspection 

## Overview

For giving clients confidents for fabrication on Huge Show Action Equipments, i were told to create a document of our current process to client to ensure that client know what we are doing. I setout to create an A3 package of a full welding and inspection process. 

## Highlights

The document is a package about after steps after receiving a fully designed drawings, It listed over 35 steps from creating fabrication drawings to welding inspection. It is detailed with image and sample images of us doing the process in the past, key items included:
- Pre-fabrication Drawing and model
- Prepare Fabrication
- Welding Process
- Pre/Post Weld Treatment
- Inspection and Post Welding clean and surface treatment.

## Impact

All clients saw this document and relating drawings immediates is confident about our fabrication process. Many clients were asking if we can give them soft copies that we rightfully declined.
