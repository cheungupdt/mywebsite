# Company Standard

## Overview

One of the issues during recruitment process is after someone is onboarded. How to train the person. Manual mentoring is not efficient enough and all mentors may have slight variation on understanding of the company's process. My boss asked me to create a company standard as i was extremely well in creating the weld and inspection procedures years before. Such company standards will enable team's alignment on understanding on all design and fabrication matters. It will also enable an easy onboarding process to new hires. 

## Highlights

- Internal fabrication tolerance, External fabrication tolerance
- Base Default weld call out, and welding methods and treatment and QC requirements
- Standard Size of Parent Materials and prefer default size due to procurement.
- Preferred Actuators, and Bearings, Bolts and other fasteners.
- File naming convention, and transfer and synchronization process
- Reports and drawings standards

## Impact

This drastically saved a lot of effort in training, in addition, it saved a lot of alignment process as this process triggered many internal discussion to ensure internal team's alignment.
