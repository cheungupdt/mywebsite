# Achievements

My career is built on a foundation of consistent delivery, safety excellence, and technical innovation. Having managed 30+ annual shows at Hong Kong Disneyland Resort with zero major injury reports, I've established a track record of reliable execution under pressure. My work has been recognized by industry leaders and has directly contributed to company success through budget adherence, on-time delivery, and licensing compliance.

The "Best Vendor Award" for Artech Design and Production for outstanding service to Disney Theme Parks represents more than just recognition—it validates my approach to transforming artistic vision into technical reality while exceeding safety requirements. This achievement was earned through meticulous project management, innovative structural solutions, and a relentless focus on quality that elevated vendor performance to new standards.
