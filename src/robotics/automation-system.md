# Automation Systems

## Overview

Automation systems form the backbone of modern manufacturing, enabling precision, efficiency, and consistency at scale. My expertise spans from single-station automation to complete factory-wide integration.

## Key Technologies

### PLC Programming
- **Platforms**: Siemens S7, Allen-Bradley ControlLogix, Omron NJ/NX
- **Languages**: Ladder Logic, Structured Text, Function Block Diagram
- **Protocols**: PROFINET, EtherNet/IP, Modbus TCP/IP

### HMI Development
- **Software**: WinCC, FactoryTalk View, Ignition SCADA
- **Features**: Real-time monitoring, historical trending, alarm management
- **Integration**: ERP/MES connectivity for data-driven decisions

### Robotics Integration
- **Brands**: KUKA, FANUC, ABB, Universal Robots
- **Applications**: Pick and place, assembly, welding, packaging
- **Programming**: KRL, TP, RAPID, URScript

## Project Examples
