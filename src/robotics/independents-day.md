# Independents' Day Monster

## Overview

We were told the monster from previous vendor looks horrible. We redesign the whole monster and related system, and delivered to the clients within short time.

The issues with artist is that it is tough to present what they want to a feasible animatronics movement. So the previous vendor struggle to make this work. 

Our ability to make proposals makes this monster both lively and significantly lengthen the live of this Monster.
