# Law Ka Ying Humanoid

## Overview

With the request to build such humanoid. We immediately interact with the Legendary Cantonese Opra Artist - Law Ka Ying for a 3D scan and some demo of the movement. As humanoid robotic design is not something new to us, the design is actually much easier than we predicted.

We ensure the basic movement can be done, then we design all the related mechanism for this specific Humanoid. Since we are in COVID period. Part of the key issues of this project is to remotely communicate with team members for collaboration.
