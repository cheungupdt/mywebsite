# Coral Monster

Located in Chimelong Spaceship- we were told it was the largest indoor animatronics at the time.


## Overview

The Coral Monster has many degree of motions to make it full featured. We were given the artistic rendering and basic motion it want to achieve. We then visualize the effect, further design, engineering, and fabricated the Coral Monster.

## Design Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- Payload capacity and reach requirements
- Working envelope analysis
- Speed and precision specifications
- Environmental considerations
- Hazard Analysis
- Floor Bearing Load requirements
- Timeline
- QA/QC Strategy
- Insurance

### 2. Kinematic Design
- DH parameter optimization
- Joint configuration selection
- Workspace analysis

### 3. Dynamic Analysis
- Inertia calculations
- Torque requirements

### 4. Actuator Analysis
- Refine motion with real actuator data
- Longevity analysis

With other design process, we went to further design requirement like machining, welding, various procurement process (note that as the actuators and bearings are not consumer sizes, there are various process to speedup the design (one bearing quoted us 36 months of lead time and we have to find ways to make the design work as we only have 6-7 months to  complete the whole design fabrication to start with. 

We went through all needed heat treatment, surface treatment of metals (and needed coatings), all structural and mechanism testing, maintenance strategies, and daily operation strategies, shipping, and installation, we finally got this done within the 6-7 month time frame requested.
