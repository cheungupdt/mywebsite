# Sensor Integration

## Overview

Modern robotics relies heavily on sophisticated sensor systems for perception, navigation, and decision-making. My expertise encompasses the full sensor integration pipeline from hardware selection to data processing algorithms.

## Sensor Technologies

### Vision Systems
- **2D Cameras**: High-speed cameras for vision
- **3D Vision**: Structured light and time-of-flight systems
- **Thermal Imaging**: Temperature monitoring and defect detection

### Proximity & Range
- **Ultrasonic**: Cost-effective distance measurement
- **Infrared**: Precise short-range detection

### Force & Torque
- **Force/Torque**: Precise force control for assembly
- **Tactile Arrays**: Surface pressure distribution
- **Current Sensing**: Motor load monitoring
- **Vibration Analysis**: Predictive maintenance

## Data Processing Pipeline
