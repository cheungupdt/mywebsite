# Structural Innovation
As an engineer by trade, I have strong Structural Analysis and Fatigue Analysis background

## Overview

In the field of well established Structural Engineering, there are still many ways I've been managed to create lasting impact and reduce business operation cost. 

## Design Loading Innovation

In the field of engineering, loading is very established, there maybe additional cases to add or there are minor loading changes subjected to Code of Practice or other standards. Through many problem solving strategies, i managed to make minor design change to significantly reduced my company's liability, fabrication hassle, reduce cost and time, while making all the engineering team from vendor to client all marveled and happy to sign their name to it.

### Shifting the 80mm hole by 5mm 

There was a key loading cases in which I shifted one hole by 5mm (with also added tolerance requirment), i managed to get the structure's weight loading to only 50%  (from 20kN down to 10kN), all with a single simple hole shifting.

### Strengthen by Member Reduction

Many engineers likes to reinforce structure when the design doesn't meet requirement. While many times this helps, but there are situations that reducing members yields a better Factor of Safety. I always instruct my team to take into consideration of material's strength and elasticity. Often times, I'm able to find removal of members yield Factor of Safety improvement, counter intuitive, ain't it?

### Strengthen by Weld Reduction

Often times designer likes to design with welds that is "Full Strength", more weld is better type of mindset. Often times, this is true and it gains factor of safety, on paper. However, that doesn't mean it is "more safe". Designers are not aware that more welds means more heat input, distortion, and more internal stress. If not properly managed, i saw a case that a structure has a full punching shear (due to weld design issue) failure and rendered the strucrue useless. Granted, i often let my team to go forth with Full strength Butt Weld, and full penetration (CJP) welds because the design's need, but i will make sure only teammates who knows this serious issues should ever approve the design.
