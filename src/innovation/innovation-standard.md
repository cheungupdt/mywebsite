# Structural Innovation

## Overview

In the field of well established Structural Engineering, there are still many ways I've been managed to create lasting impact and reduce business operation cost. 

## Design Loading Innovation

In the field of engineering, loading is very established, there maybe additional cases to add or there are minor loading changes subjected to Code of Practice or other standards. Through many problem solving strategies, i managed to make very minor design change to significantly reduced my company's liability, fabrication hazzle, reduce cost and time, while making all the engineering team from vendor to client all marveled and happy to sign their name to it.

### Shifting the 80mm hole by 5mm 

There was a key loading cases in which I shifted one hole by 5mm (with also added tolerance requirment), i managed to get the structure's weight loading to only 50%  (from 20kN down to 10kN), all with a single simple hole shifting.
