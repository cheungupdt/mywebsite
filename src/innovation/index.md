# Innovation Portfolio

True innovation in technical fields isn't about novelty for its own sake—it's about solving real problems with elegant, practical solutions. My innovation approach combines engineering rigor with creative thinking, demonstrated through achievements like reducing structural loading by 50% through a 5mm hole shift, or strengthening assemblies by strategically removing (rather than adding) members. These counterintuitive solutions emerge from deep analysis rather than conventional thinking, delivering significant cost savings and performance improvements.

At Artech Design and Production, I innovated the company's entire knowledge management approach, creating standardized tools and templates that accelerated engineering calculations 3x-5x while reducing errors. At Hong Kong Disneyland, I established protocols for the Entertainment Department's first outdoor animatronics—navigating unique HKBD requirements that previously limited such installations to Imagineering. These innovations share a common thread: they're grounded in practical constraints (budget, timeline, regulations) while expanding what's technically possible.

## Innovation Philosophy

### Core Principles
- **Human-Centered**: Solving real problems for real people within actual constraints
- **Business-Valued**: Delivering measurable improvements to efficiency, cost, or quality
- **Data-Driven**: Using analysis and simulation to guide creative solutions
- **Iterative**: Testing and refining based on real-world feedback
- **Collaborative**: Leveraging diverse perspectives from artists to technicians
- **Sustainable**: Creating solutions that deliver long-term value

### Innovation Mindset
- **Curiosity**: Questioning assumptions and exploring alternatives
- **Courage**: Proposing unconventional solutions with analytical justification
- **Resilience**: Learning from setbacks and persisting through complexity
- **Openness**: Incorporating feedback from all stakeholders
- **Discipline**: Applying structured thinking to creative challenges
