# Collaborative Communication

## Overview

As leaders in company, our goal is to resolve issues. Our boss sometimes could be irrational, making impractical decisions. Sometimes, to save the boss's face, we may have to take on blames that we didn't cause in the first place to be a "Team Player". But our goal is clear, our goal is to resolve issues and make the boss "looks good". Collaborative communication is like that, we seek for solutions of common goods, rather than mere personal justice. But we also need to be right and credible for our decision, so a right balance is important

## 
## Know the Situation
We need to know the situation, even for the same thing like "the place looks messy" is totally different when it comes from a direct report, verses your boss's manager. Lower management often get confused that why some of the lower level task was placed with such a high piority. It is because if it was said by my direct reports, other people just need to prove to my direct report that the place is tidied up. Whereas the boss's manager said it, my boss need to prove to HIS manager that it is tidied up. This is a huge difference in resource usage. Where the concern originate is always important step to resolve communication issues.

##
## Know the Root Issue
Sometimes issues was just because the upper management was pressured by their management. Sometimes could be jsut a simple message that doesn't carry weight, or sometimes they do, we have to identify this.  Our goal is to resolve their issue. A simple message from upper management that they saw the fire broke out and want to know how do we responds. Our goal is to give them the confidence that they can rely on us, and we have a full plan to back them up. Fire broke out in a building, then how to we tell our boss that our product is fire resistent; Some screen fall down, we have to tell our boss that appropriate secondary safety devices are in place. Knowing the Root Issue that trigger the work and concern can drastically reduce the effort to address the issue.

## Know what are the Common Good
Sometimes we were challenged by other people in other department, they got issues came to us because they cannot get the issues fixed with their management. Instead of leveling up everyone's game and requirment, a simple past history, or standard excerpt maybe all it needs to resolve their immediate concern. Knowing each other's difficulty is the key to Collaboration.
